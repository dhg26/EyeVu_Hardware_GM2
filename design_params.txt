Design is split into 2 halves - lens tube + handle assembly 

Lens tube design: 
- Lens are 50mm in diameter 
- Need adjustment and holding mechanism for lens 
- No real idea how long the tube needs to be for the lens to work

Handle assembly: 
- Needs to house raspi, battery, bms
- May need to house stepper motor/screen depending on future design approach 
- Magnetic charging
